## Overview

The `MigrationHelper` contract is a simple helper contract to atomically perform the transfer of many loans. This is designed to make the liquidity migration procedure both easier and more robust.

The `AccountingChecker` contract (in `contracts/checkers`) is a helper contract to check the value represented in the `LoanManager` contract against a naive calculation to ensure correctness.

## Setup

This project was built using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). Refer to installation instructions [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:maple-labs/migration-helpers.git
cd migration-helpers
forge install
```


## Usage

- To run all tests: `forge test`
- To run specific tests: `forge test --match <test_name>`

`./scripts/test.sh` is used to enable Foundry profile usage with the `-p` flag. Profiles are used to specify the number of fuzz runs.
